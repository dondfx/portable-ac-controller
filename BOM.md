## üìå Notes

- This controller is designed for **manual or automatic** AC compressor control using onboard sensors and user inputs.
- Input voltage to the 7805 regulator should be < 35V.
- OLED uses **I2C interface** (SCL/SDA) and requires a 3.3V/5V tolerant supply (SSD1306 compatible).
- The **rotary potentiometers** are connected via voltage dividers for manual analog adjustments.
- **Interrupt-driven push buttons** are debounced in software and allow precise temp setpoint control.
- Always ensure **thermal dissipation** for the 7805 regulator if housed in an enclosure.
- Debug interfaces were dropped to save space.
- The Arduino Nano is socketed on the PCB and can be reprogrammed via USB.
